The newly appointed Vice Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create a automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enter a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.

Write a program to solve the given problem.

 Marks scored            Grade
100                      S
(90,100)                 A
(80,90)                  B
(70,80)                  C
(60,70)                  D
(50,60)                  E
<50                      F

The interval [a,b) includes all numbers greater than or equal to a and less than b.

Input and Output Format:
Input consists of a single integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student. Print Invalid Input if it is not in the range 0 to 100.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input 1:
85

Sample Output 1:
B

Sample Input 2:
850

Sample Output 2
Invalid Input

program:
i=int(input())
i>=0 and i<=100
if(i==100):
    print("S")
elif(i>=90 and i<100):
    print("A")
elif(i>=80 and i<90):
    print("B")
elif(i>=70 and i<80):
    print("C")
elif(i>=60 and i<70):
    print("D")
elif(i>=50 and i<60):
    print("E")
elif(i<50):
    print("F")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
