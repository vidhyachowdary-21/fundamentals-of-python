A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

Input Format:
The first input is an integer which corresponds to the number of items. The second integer is a float which corresponds to the single item heating time.

Output Format:
Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.

Note:All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output

Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50

Sample Input and Output 2:
Enter the number of items
4
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
Number of items is more

program:
n=int(input("Enter the number of items:"))
t=float(input("Enter the single item heating time:"))
if n==2:
    r=t+(0.5)*t
    s="{:.2f}".format(r)
    print("The recommended heating time is",s)
elif n==3:
    r=2*(t)
    print("The recommended heating time is",r)
elif n>3:
    print("Number of items is more")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
