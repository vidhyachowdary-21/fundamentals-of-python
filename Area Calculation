Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes. 

Input format: 
First input: a side of a square in integer 
Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 

Output format: 
The first output should be the area of a square in integer 
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 
The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Sample Input: 
5
5
4
2.0

Sample Output: 
25
20
12.56

program:
a=int(input("enter a side of a square"))
b=int(input("enter length of a rectangle"))
c=int(input("enter breadth of a rectangle"))
d=float(input("enter radius of a circle"))
ars=a*a
ar=b*c
arc=3.14*d*d
print(ars)
print(ar)
print("%.2f"%arc)
